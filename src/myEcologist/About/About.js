            <h5>Welcome to myEcologist: Connecting People with Nature</h5>

            <p>myEcologist is a web development final project of Jae Butler, Dae Chung, Apurva Kolhe, and Chaia Yodaiken at Northeastern University in 2023. </p>

            <p> At myEcologist, we believe in the power of community-driven science and the profound impact it can have on our understanding of the natural world. Inspired by the success of platforms like iNaturalist, we set out to create a space where individuals, whether seasoned ecologists or enthusiastic nature lovers, can come together to explore, document, and celebrate the biodiversity that surrounds us.</p>
